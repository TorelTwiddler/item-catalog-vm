Item Catalog
===============

This is for Project 3 of the Udacity Full Stack Developer Nanodegree.

The Item Catalog project is a simple app that allows storage of categories of items. You must log in using a Google account in order to be able to edit or delete anything, but there are no other restrictions.


To Use
----------

This project uses Vagrant. To start the virtual machine:

    vagrant up

If it doesn't connect you to the VM automatically:

    vagrant ssh

Then navigate to the project directory:

    cd /vagrant/catalog

From here, you can run the application:

    python application.py

You can then navigate to `http://localhost:5000/` to view the project!
